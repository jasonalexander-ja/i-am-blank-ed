## Install and run.

Make sure NPM + NodeJS are both installed.

Run `npm i` in the root directory to install all relevant packages. 

Run `npm build` to produce all the site files into `./build`.

These files should then be copied and pasted into the `host` branch, which when pushed, will be used
by GitHub to host the paage itself.
